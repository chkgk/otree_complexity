# Notes

## Cost calculation

- there should be a cost per time unit for each unit in stock
- we need to have this animated on the JS side
- it needs to be kept in sync with the server, if clients count on their own.

- in addition, we calculate the cost on the server and send updates to the client with every stock change

### server side
- now - last stock update time = storage time
- storage time * cost per time unit = cost
- accumulated cost = old_cost + cost


### client side
