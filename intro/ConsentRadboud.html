        <b>Research Procedure:</b> You will participate in an experiment with other anonymous participants. In a computer environment, you and others will make decisions that affect your monetary consequences from this experiment. During the experiment, you will 1) fill in this consent form, 2) read and understand the introductions for the tasks, 3) undergo a non-paid training task to comprehend the task better, 4) participate in several distinct tasks of which one randomly chosen task determines your earnings, 5) fill in a short questionnaire, and 6) provide your bank details for the payment. This experiment will not take longer than 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Benefits, discomfort, and risks:</b> Upon fully completing the experiment, you will earn a completion fee of
        {{ participation_fee }} and a substantial bonus depending on your and other participants’ decisions (more details will be provided in the instructions). During the experiment, you will not get to know the other participants in your group, nor will others get to know you. Hence, we foresee no physical or mental risks. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The recipients of the personal data:</b> We need your first and last name and IBAN for the payment. To separate your personal data from the experimental data, you will provide them in a separate save environment. Your earnings will be transferred within three weeks by the finance department of Radboud University. This personal information is decoupled from your choices in the experiment and your answers to a questionnaire. The raw data from your decisions will be used for analysis and publication in a scientific article and for placement in a publicly accessible data repository, but your data cannot be traced back to your person.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The retention period for the data:</b> Research data underlying a scientific publication must be stored for at least 10 years after publication, according to Radboud University’s research data management policy.
